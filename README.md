# Chatbot for Admissions in FPT University

This repository contains the code and resources for implementing a chatbot aimed at enhancing admissions efficiency at FPT University, Ho Chi Minh City. The chatbot leverages the Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to provide timely and relevant responses to inquiries from prospective students.

## Introduction

Communication between potential students and university departments often involves manual processes that consume significant time and resources. To address this challenge, we propose the development of a chatbot capable of efficiently handling admissions inquiries, thereby streamlining the application process and improving user experience.

## Key Features

- **RAG Framework**: The chatbot employs the Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, which integrates retrieval-based methods and generative approaches to enhance natural language processing capabilities.

- **Fine-tuned Models**: We fine-tune models, such as vietzephyr-7b-lora-8bit, on the Vietnamese dataset vilm/OpenOrca-Viet to optimize chatbot performance for the target audience.
  
- **Dataset Integration**: The chatbot utilizes multiple datasets, including the vilm/OpenOrca-Viet dataset and the Student Handbook dataset, to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preparation**: Contains scripts and resources for collecting, preprocessing, and formatting datasets.
  
- **Model Training**: Includes code for training and fine-tuning language models using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
  
- **Chatbot Implementation**: Consists of scripts and modules for implementing the chatbot using the RAG architecture and integrating with retrieval and generation components.
